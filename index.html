          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            Rotting Orchards is brought to you by Mike and Eesa Heijmans. Looking back on their childhoods, they both fondly remembered the neighborhood haunted houses and how much fun it was to go through as kids and work in as teenagers. So in October 2013, while setting up their yard decorations and reminiscing over childhood Halloweens, they decided they would host their own haunted house. Little did they know that it would be the start of an obsession. After the 2013 Halloween season was over, they looked back on the fun and magic of running a haunted house and decided that it would have to happen again the next year and it would need to be even better!
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            In 2014, Mike and Eesa unleashed their skills by designing and building their own mechanical props. They went bigger and better than the previous year and raised money for a great cause in the process. The neighbors and local youth organizations helped out and the news even showed up! The season was a success despite the rain but it needed to be even better still!
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            In late 2014, due to landlord disagreements and the rapidly rising costs of the bay area, Mike and Eesa moved to Elk Grove, CA (outside of Sacramento). They relocated themselves, their lives, and the haunt in the process. The chaos of the move, job changes, and buying a house left little time to expand the haunt but that didn't stop them. They buckled down, worked hard and built a new haunt for 2015 in their new location in Elk Grove. It was their biggest event to date drawing more than 400 people! Unfortunately the amount of people was overwhelming and someone decided to take advantage of that and stole a large sum from the donation box. This sparked the idea of forming their own non-profit that could better help the community year round and help build up a volunteer base to prevent such things from happening again.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            In 2016, The Heijmans Foundation, Inc was formed. The primary goal of the foundation is to benefit local arts, music, &amp; theatre community through donations. All proceeds from the Rotting Orchards Haunted House go directly to the foundation and go directly to local community arts programs in turn.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The 2016 Haunted House in Elk Grove drew over a thousand people from hundreds of miles away over the Haunt's 3 open days and it was the haunt's first multi-day event. The amount of money raised for the foundation set a new record for Rotting Orchards and the foundation for a single event.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The rave reviews from haunt-goers and other haunt operators were growing and it was apparent that the skills that Mike and Eesa were mastering were become more soughtafter. Therefore in 2017, Rotting Orchards expanded once again by adding consulting services as an offering. The new Rotting Orchards Haunted House Consulting project is aimed at helping others, from home haunters to professional establishments, create the best expierence in this niche space for their visitors through design, custom prop building, and event coordination.
