        <h1 class="alert">Thank You</h1>
          <p>
            A thank you to all that came out and supported Raising a Reader this year and enjoyed all the hard work and time we put into making Halloween night a fright for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            A special thank you is extended to the Witt family, who spent their Halloween volunteering inside the haunt as actors and scaresmiths. They really made the experience unforgettable!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though we had a great time and a great turn out, the night was not without a party pooper... We had someone steal money out of our donation box! It appears that they took the larger bills that were sitting on top. To say that we're upset is an understatement. We are both heartbroken and angered by the actions of this one individual and this individual has removed almost all the joy out of the night for us both. We had over 400 people come through but only have $179 to show for it. We will be supplementing what we can to get us closer to what we <i>think</i> the number should have been without the theft but we feel like we failed Raising a Reader and all of the people that came out and gave their hard-earned money to help the fight against illiteracy in our <b>LOCAL</b> community. Its just disheartening to discover that some self-indulgent ass feels compelled to take that money from us and you. We will be forwarding all of our evidence to the police and pursuing full legal action against those that stole from us, Raising a Reader, and you!
          </p>
          <p>
            We are truly sorry that we lost some of your contributions to the cause, you trusted us and we failed you. Next year will be different. We have now learned that we can't be as open and trusting as we have been in the past. We will be making some major changes for 2016, that's for sure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rotting Orchards is just the two of us and whatever volunteers we can rope in to help as actors for the night. we can't continue like this though. Its gotten to be too much for just the two of us to handle on our own. This is evidenced by the lapse of security at the donations box. So we've decided that we are going to need help if we continue putting on this show every year. We will need help with setting up, tearing down, acting, crowd wrangling, security, and more. If you're interested please leave your name, email, and phone number on this form and we'll keep you in the loop: <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/t62tLcHgpk" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/forms/t62tLcHgpk</a> (we won't share your info with anyone)
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you again to all that came out for the night.
          </p>
