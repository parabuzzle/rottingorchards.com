            Rotting Orchards is brought to you by Mike and Lisa Heijmans. Looking back on their childhoods, they both fondly remembered the neighborhood haunted houses and how much fun it was to go through as kids, and work in as teenagers. So in October 2013, while setting up their yard decorations and reminiscing over childhood Halloweens, they decided they would host their own haunted house. Little did they know that it would be the start of an obsession. After the 2013 Halloween season was over, they looked back on the fun and magic of running a haunted house and decided that it would have to happen again the next year and it would need to be even better. Lisa decided they should raise money to help the local community and it was decided that they would help the <a href="http://www.raisingareader.org/" target="_blank">Raising a Reader</a> program because it directly helps people in their own community.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2014, Mike and Lisa unleashed their skills by designing and building their own mechanical props. They went bigger and better than the previous year and raised money for a great cause in the process. The neighbors and local youth organizations helped out and the news even showed up! The season was a success despite the rain but it needed to be even better still!
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
          In late 2014, due to landlord disagreements and the rapidly rising costs of the bay area, Mike and Lisa moved to Elk Grove, CA (outside of Sacramento). They relocated themselves, their lives, and the haunt in the process. The chaos of the move, job changes, and buying a house left little time to expand the haunt but that didn't stop them. They buckled down, worked hard and built a new haunt for 2015 in their new location in Elk Grove. It promises to be scarier then the previous years and to thrill in ways that its never thilled before.
